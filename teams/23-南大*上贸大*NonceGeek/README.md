**Problem:**

Traditional Web2 online name cards have more costs and lower efficiency on information verified.

Traditional personal websites have more mental costs on light social since they are not designed by web3 builders

Job seekers are in a weak position because the personal information proprietorship, using rights, usufruct and rights of management of traditional recruiting website are separated. 

The remote & global recruitment channels are not clear enough for the rapidly increasing of web3 builders’ population.

**Background**

1. Building a building block "soul card" based on human social nature

Recently, E. Glen Weyl, Puja Ohlhaver, Vitalik Buterin and others published their paper "Decentralized Society: In Search of the Soul of Web3". The paper represents the trend of the next decade in blockchain - extending from purely distributed finance (Defi) to explore both the path of distributed finance and distributed society (DeSoc).

The basic building blocks of the distributed society are the various communities including DAO (Distributed Self-Organization). A community is a community in a broad sense - a DAO is a community, an occupation is a community, and the residents of a community can also be a community.

In our opinion, if we want to build a blockchain-based distributed society (DeSoc based on Blockchain), it is an important first step to build **onchain business cards** that can mark the identity of the soul (see the paper for the meaning of soul) communities.

Admittedly, there are already many blockchain projects that deal with this proposition to a greater or lesser extent, especially those related to socialization - such as ENS.

However, the various facilities available are far from mature and suffer from at least the following major problems.

- **Only Web3 is not enough**

Since the landing point is to build a person's "soul", the soul built by data only from the Web3 world, or even only from the virtual world, is one-sided. In the case of blockchain developers as a soul type, it is not enough to have their on-chain behavior data as a data source, and their data on Github is also extremely important - although Github is "centralized".

- **Insufficient building blocks**

The various projects that do not build profiles have not yet been "building blocked" to allow soul builders the freedom to build their profiles, which is necessary in an on-chain world where we need a significant degree of "soul pinching freedom" (like face pinching freedom in games). If we can only follow a dead format, then the souls we pinch must also be dead.

- **Not taking into account the human "social nature "**

Existing products do not think in terms of sociology and psychology, so the match with human "social nature" is extremely limited. For example, people socialize according to the "law of first sight". For example, it is said that the first x seconds of perceptual judgment in an interview already determines the outcome, and all subsequent communication is just to find reasons for the outcome. We will not pursue the rigor of this argument, but it is important to make a good first impression in a short period of time. Therefore, in the physical world of social interaction, we will have all kinds of codes in order to enhance the first impression, such as the Dress Code of various places.

In the virtual world, this thing becomes interesting. Because in the physical world, the first touch between people is more of a "contact touch", followed by a "contactless touch". But in the virtual world, "contactless touch" is very common. Articles, videos, websites and other channels are important ways for us to get to know someone for the first time.

Therefore, in this case, how to efficiently make a good and deep first impression on a potential social object is a **very important proposition** for communication in the virtual world.

This cannot be achieved if it is simply an unthought-out **message pile** - like the smelly, long resumes we often see in our mailboxes. Therefore, there is a need to think further about this matter at the product design level and design products that are more in line with human "social nature" - something that is currently lacking in the DeSocial space.

2. Structural Hole Theory and "Crossed Souls"

> **structural holes** is a concept from [social network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_network) research, originally developed by [Ronald Stuart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Stuart_Burt) Burt. The study of structural holes spans the fields of sociology, economics, and computer science. Burt introduced this concept in an attempt to explain the origin of differences in [social capital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_capital). Burt’s theory suggests that individuals hold certain positional advantages/disadvantages from how they are embedded in neighborhoods or other social structures. A structural hole is understood as a gap between two individuals who have complementary sources to information.

Therefore, when designing the SoulCard product, we had to think more fully about how SoulCard could better bring to light the key people who fill the holes in the structure -- people who have often been invisible in the past -- and how it could be a win-win situation for both the key nodes themselves and the social networks they connect to. It's a win-win situation. For example, a key person who is both a Coder & Designer and who is an active participant in both a DevDAO and a DesignDAO has the potential to lead the exchange of resources between the two DAOs, creating new possibilities and new value. In DeSoc, we can name the soul of such a person as **"Cross-Soul "**.

3. Trust in new cooperative relationships

> In his Philosophy of Money and Foundations of Social Theory, Zimmer suggests that trust is an important condition for exchange mechanisms and a prerequisite for the continuity of sociality. The sociologist James Coleman devotes a large part of his magnum opus, The Foundations of Social Theory, to trust as an important component of social capital (Robert D . Trust helps to increase the efficiency of microeconomic organizations.

Reducing the cost of building trust and eliminating barriers to building trust both require authenticity of information exchange (verified profile) and effectiveness of structure building (short time to the right person, shortest path to the right person).

4. Decentralized diffusion of DAO brand

Like any other organization, DAOs still need branding. In addition to traditional brand building ideas, DAOs should also consider a more decentralized (and likewise more primitive 😁) approach to communication -

> **Mouth-to-Mouth**

In this case, it is essential to let the DAO develop the Template for the business card, so that each DAO member can be his or her own salesman and also become a DAO salesman by the way. Therefore, in the design of SoulCard, we need to take into account three types of roles.

> **Member:** Promote themselves through SoulCard so as to gain Serendipity by getting more high-quality, interesting person-to-person connections without contact.

> **DAO:** Let Members become their own "salesman", and at the same time make members have a stronger sense of value identification with DAO.

> **Receiver:** People who see SoulCard can quickly and efficiently understand the people they are in contact with and the organizations behind them.

5. Information Entropy and Value

Traditional resumes and profiles have no mechanism to avoid lengthy, dull information, and the low concentration of effective information reduces the sense of value to the Profile Owner.

The traditional solution is to increase the information density and value of the profile through some resume-related courses, but we believe that this can be solved mechanically - for example, by having the SoulCard Owner provide only the 3 most valuable articles that he/she has written when providing technical articles.

**Introduction:**

When considering about the grand vision of constructing DeSoc based on Blockchain, NonceGeekDAO believes that a proposal of creating DID Credential for Builder groups and the on chain SoulCard which can represent the soul of ethnic groups are the most important first step. 

Compare to LinkedIn, a kind of traditional  way on showing personal information, Soulcard has below characteristics:

 * Multiple pages turning Soulcard has more information density, which can be inserted into multiple social scenes such as Mirror articles and Twitters.
* DAO Owner will be required to verify when builder behaviors mint as NFT to ensure the credibility of SoulCard through a mechanism.
* Skills recorded on SoulCard can be verified by Challenges records and Github PR records
* After the SoulCard Owner joins the DAO, the information about the DAO it participates in which carried by SoulCard that will effectively and clearly marking the Owner's population.
* SoulCard contains the Web3 footprint of its Owner.
